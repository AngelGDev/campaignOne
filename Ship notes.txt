If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.


COMBAT

Critical hits on the ship

D10 Roll 	Effect
1 	Fire!
2 	Ship Shaken!
3 	Hull Holed!
4 	1d4 Speed loss for 1d6 tactical turns
5 	Random Ship Weapon Damaged
6 	Exterior crew Damage!
7 	Interior crew Damage!
8 	1d6 Maneuverability loss for 1d6 tactical turns
9 	Ship Shaken!
10 	Exterior crew Damage!


Fire!- A fire starts somewhere inside of or on the ship, determined by the DM.  If a fire is unable to start for some reason then roll again.

Ship Shaken- All crewman not otherwise secured (Helmsman is considered secured) must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and dealt 2d6 falling damage.  On a critical failure a crewman on the outside of the ship or in an area with an open hull is thrown overboard.

Hull Holed- The attack punches a sizable hole in the ship. DM decides location unless targeted by a ramming maneuver.  If a Tiny ship suffers a Hull Holed Critical Hit it's internal structure is destroyed and the ship starts to break apart.  A ship can survive one Hull Holed Critical Hit per size category above Tiny before being torn apart.

Speed Loss- The ship loses the specified amount of speed for 1d6 Tactical Turns (min 1). If the ship is already at Speed 1, then any remaining balance should be subtracted from Maneuverability.

Random ship weapon damaged- A randomly chosen ship weapon (Siege or Spelltech) is damaged and inoperable until repaired. Duration of repair is 1d4 Tactical Turns and requires a proficient crew member to perform.  Any crew on the weapon is unharmed.  If no weapons exist on-board the ship, roll again.

Exterior crew Damage- One creature on the exterior of the ship is struck suffering either the same damage as the ship. Choose the target randomly from all exterior crew. All creatures within 5ft of that individual must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or suffer the same damage.  If a ship has no exterior crew then roll again.

Interior crew Damage- Same as an Exterior crew Damage Critical Hit, but everyone inside is a potential target, including prisoners and Helmsman. This is a result not of a direct weapon hit so much as shattered parts of the ship, shrapnel, and the bouncing around during combat.

Maneuverability Loss- The ship loses the specified amount of maneuverability for 1d6 Tactical Turns (min 0). If the ship is already at Maneuverability 0, then any remaining balance should be subtracted from Speed (min 1).
