Aiding a skill check

Player A rolls a skill check
Player B rolls aid DC 10. On success add +2 
Player C rolls aid DC 10. On success add +2
etc



Skill challenge/test

kind of like interactive cutscenes. narrative/action/tension that doesnt work well with grid combat
chase scenes, escape scenes,  

everyone makes skill checks, aiding possible

METHOD

track successes vs failures
number of successes vs 3 failures
5 successes vs 3 failure for a moderate challenge
accumulate 3 failures, group fails (fail to escape, get thrown into the water)
acrobatics or athletics when performing physical feats
nature to find wind, heat, weather etc
tell players its a "minigame" and explain win conditions
give 2 skills that could absolutely help (survival to retrace steps, insight to find shortcuts, athletics to make a long jump)
basically role play your character's skills, an attempt to capture a dramatic action sequence
you have to be proficient to make a test
once you make an attempt with one skill, you can't repeat it yourself. other players can use the skill.
players have to describe how they use said skill to test
dm describes scuccess or failure in a dramatic way
write down consequences of failing single test, and entire challenge(damage, environment hazards, exhaustion +1)
add ways to undop failures, different valid skill from another character
consider allowing utility, instant spells
